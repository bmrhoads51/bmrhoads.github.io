      <p>The first task was to rectify an image of a planar surface taken from an angle. For this part, I took a picture of two sticky notes with phrases written on them. From an angle, they are difficult to read, as shown below: </p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>The image below shows the points chosen as the four correspondence points for each sticky note. The points were obtained by estimating the locations of each point, plotting the point on the image, and then adjusting the location until the points were on the corners of the sticky notes, which correspond to the corners of the square matrix the images will be warped to. </p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>The rectified images of the two sticky notes are shown below, which clearly show the phrases written on the sticky notes. To see the accuracy of the rectified images, a bird's eye view image is shown which clearly shows the phrases on the sticky notes without any warping. There is slight deformation in the edges of the sticky notes of rectified image B, which is caused by the slight curvature in the sticky note. The process used here is a linear matrix transformation, so it cannot account for curvature in the sticky note. </p>

      <h2>Part 2 - Creative Application (Exploration &amp; Extension)</h2>

      <p>For this part of the project, I decided to use images from Google Maps of the Ole Miss football field. I used streetview from the middle of the field and took eight screenshots facing north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. The goal was then to reconstruct the bird's eye view of the field using the images from the streetview. Below are the screenshots used. </p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>For every screenshot, I chose 4 correspondence points to rectify. Specific sections of the field were chosen for the 8 different pictures so that they could combine to make the full field, with the exception of the very center of the field, since that is where the pictures are taken from. Padding was added on the sides of the image so I could place some correspondence points oustide of the image. This was required when the section of the field I wanted to capture extended beyond part of the frame. Had I not done this, I would not have been able to keep as much of the screenshot, thus increasing the size of the portion of the field left blank. Also, note that the corner images capture very distance portions of the field and therefore take up a very small part of the frames. This will cause a lot more blurriness when warping these images, and could only be improved by moving the location when taking the screenshot or taking the photo from a higher angle. The correspondence points on each image are shown below. </p>

      </div>

      <p>Next, the 8 images are placed on a large matrix in their expected position. There is slight overlap in some of the rectified images, so for the pixels where there is overlap, the pixel values are averaged together. The final stitched image is shown below. </p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>The stitching was clearly not perfect, since it was very difficult to accurately rectify parts of the field, especially the distant parts. Also, the images are taken from pretty low, so the angle is very small, meaning the field is very flattened. The north and south photos rectified the best since these were the closest regions to the center of the field, and the middle of the field is left blank. Also, to improve the final image, I could have taken pictures from different point of views along the field to get better resolution and thus obtain a better result. </p>

    <!-- =================================== -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Part 3 - Warping Comparison (Triangular Mesh vs Thin-Plate Spline)</h2>

      <p>For the triangular mesh warping, I used images of Jaxson Dart (https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaxson-dart/32004441-5273-5504-d6f2-f2d3f25131e8) and Lane Kiffin (https://olemisssports.com/staff-directory/lane-kiffin/634) to combine them into a single person. The first step was to choose correspodence points for both images, which included inner and outer eyes, upper and lower ears, mouth, nose, and chin.</p>

      <div class="images-row">
        <figure class="more-width">
          <img src="project-2-images/correspondence_pts.png" alt="Dart and Kiffin images side by side with selected correspondences" />
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Next, the average locations of each correspondence points over the two images were obtained, and from these points a triangular mesh was created, which is shown on each of the pictures below. </p>

      <div class="images-row">
        <figure class="more-width">
          <img src="project-2-images/triangular_meshes.png" alt="Dart and Kiffin with triangle mesh from averaged correspondences" />
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Using the triangular mesh linear warping and the thin-plate spline warping method, which is expected to be more smooth, the two original images were morphed to the average triangular mesh, and then the two images were averaged together. The results using each method are shown below for a combination of Jaxson Dart and Lane Kiffin. </p>

        <figure class="more-width">

          <figcaption>Combined images — Triangular Mesh (left) vs TPS (right).</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>For this example, it is difficult to see any difference between the two methods. However, both methods did a very good job combining the facial features of the two faces. The final face is pretty smooth and is a clear combination of Jaxson Dart and Lane Kiffin. However, the features around the face, like the ears, hair, and neck, are not very clean This is because there were not many correspondence points outside of the face, so the triangular mesh warping does not work as well on these parts of the image. Adding additional correspondence points to the neck, hair, and forehead would help improve the bad parts of the image. </p>
