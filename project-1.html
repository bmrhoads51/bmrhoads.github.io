    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 1</h2>
        <p>I took a picture of a bench on campus from up close (bottom left image) and one from far away (bottom right image), and then cropped the right photo so the bench was a similar size as the one from up close. I then drew red lines on the parallel edges in both images to see whether the images were othogonal or perspective.</p>

                <figcaption>Picture of bench taken from far away, cropped to a similar size as close up image. Red lines show parallel lines stay parallel, meaning image is orthogonal.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The left photo clearly shows that the lines are not parallel, meaning this is a perspective photo. The right photo shows that the lines are still parallel, meaning this is orthogonal. The orthogonal picture does not show perspective because the photo was taken from far away, and therefore there is relatively less difference in depth from the front of the bench to the end, so the effect of depth cannot be shown, hence it is orthogonal.</p>
